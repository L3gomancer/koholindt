## Project Awoke
I started this project mainly to teach myself web development and layouts with tiles using vanilla HTML and CSS. It's inspired by [this old old clickable map](#) which I found via [an interesting 3D modelling project](#) from years ago.
I wanted to update the code to use image maps
