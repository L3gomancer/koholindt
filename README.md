## Project Awoke
I started this project mainly to teach myself web development and layouts with tiles using vanilla HTML and CSS. It's inspired by [this old old clickable map](http://portfolio16.de/zelda/map4/map_en.htm) which I found via [an interesting 3D modelling project](http://mithosk-games.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/3d-links-awakening-major-update-29.html) from years ago.
I wanted to update the code to use image maps
